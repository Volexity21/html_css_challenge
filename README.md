# HTML and Css Challenge

The soul reason for this page is to get more of a hands on approach to a problem developers do everyday. 

## Insallation

N/A

## Usage

This page will serve as an introduction to a real website with real applications to it with great information about a product, image inclusion, and basic wepage navigation functions.

Below you will find a screenshot to my updated website.
